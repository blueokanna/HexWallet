## :question: Q&A

### 1. How to use?
Firstly, ensure that you have downloaded and installed the Arduino IDE. Proceed to configure the necessary board support packages comprehensively. Subsequently, install the required Arduino libraries for the project. Notably, you will likely need to install the **ArduinoJson** library, which can be located and downloaded via the Arduino Library Manager. Once all essential libraries have been installed, proceed to download the project code from GitHub. Open the code using the Arduino IDE and attempt to upload it to your ESP32-S3 board.

### 2. Why it doesn't work?
Please attempt to update the **ESP32 Board Manager** within the Arduino IDE and verify that all updates function correctly. Bear in mind that the current version is a **beta release**. Should you encounter any issues, feel free to report them on GitHub. I will monitor the repository and address your concerns promptly. I warmly invite all contributors to fork and submit pull requests to enhance the robustness of my project.

### 3. How can I get address and verify it?
To interface with your ESP32 board (ESP32-S3) via the serial port, you should configure your serial monitor to read the data at a baud rate of 115200. By doing so, you will be able to retrieve the mnemonic, seed, as well as the extended public key (xpub) and private key (xprv), including their respective â€˜zâ€™ counterparts for certain cryptocurrencies. For verification purposes, you can validate the generated addresses using the tool at : 
```
https://iancoleman.io/bip39/
```
Please be advised that Bitcoin addresses are generated according to the BIP84 (segwit) protocol, while other cryptocurrencies generally adhere to the BIP44 specification. Should you opt to utilize these addresses and experience any asset loss as a result, please be aware that our actions are governed by the terms outlined in our disclaimer.
